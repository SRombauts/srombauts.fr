I’ve started working on this [open source C++ Git plugin (Github)][UEGitPlugin] not long after the UE 4 “open source” release in early 2014.
I’ve released a [first rough alpha version of the plugin in May 2014 (blog)][GitPluginAlpha]. Since then, I’ve poured dozens of hours of work to maintain and improve it.

Lately they asked me for official integration, and I am proud of it!
