The idea to build my own quadcopter drone, or my own RC plane, has always been tempting. My main issue was the lack of a dedicated space to build, and more importantly, a space to fly.

I have not solved these, but at long last, I have started building my own plane (with the help of my kids :o)!

The Youtube video that got me started (in French, but see similar videos in English that also helped me) is:
