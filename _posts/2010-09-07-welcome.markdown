Welcome to this blog, where I would like to share, as a developer, some of my experiences in Android development.

Though I'll focus at first on my current endeavour in C++ Android development, it's in fact just an excuse to share about all my development-related subjects over the years.

See you,  
SRombauts

edit: Look at my [objectives for this Blog][objectives] to understand what you could expect of me.
