I am so excited to announce that I am joining the Unreal Engine 4 team to attend the [Game Developers Conference (GDC, Moscone Center in San Francisco, March 14-18 2016)][GDC2016] as a community member (with 9 other people of this great community)!

I am a senior C++ developer, with 12+ years in the industry, currently working in the transportation industry at [ENGIE INEO Systrans][INEOSystrans].

I embarked with Unreal Engine 4 immediately when UE 4.0 came out in early 2014, mainly for the opportunity to dive into its C++ code base! Iâ€™ve [developed the Git Source Control Provider Plugin (blog)][UE41GitPlugin] as a free open-source [Github project][UEGitPlugin] in my spare time.

I then had the opportunity to [integrate it officially into the Engine in 4.7][UE47GitPlugin] a year ago (just before GDC 2015) !

And now, Iâ€™ve been invited to join the Epic Games teams for this mythic event, which feels like a dream to me ðŸ™‚
