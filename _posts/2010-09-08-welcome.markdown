Welcome to this blog, where I would like to share, as a developer, some of my experiences in Android development. [^1] [^2].

See you,

edit: [^3] [objectives for this Blog][objectives]

[^1]: Android is just a mere excuses to share about any development-related subjects!
[^2]: I'll probably switch to english since it's the language for software development. I actually switched to english while updating to  WordPress 3.3.1 (on the 2011/04/07)
[^3]: Look at my [objectives for this Blog][objectives] to understand what you could expect of me.
