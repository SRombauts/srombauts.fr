My goals for this blog has not been really clear for me. I bought the domain name when I registered as a Google Android Developer only because a Web site address was required for application publishing, and I though it would be fun to share some experience. I started to write it in French

At the beginning, I did not use this blog frequently, and not the way I had expected. Lately I’ve became more active on it since I’ve discovered that what I was seeking was not sharing general though on Android, but only on some development related topic. What I like most to share are Howtos, Tutorials or easy to use Samples, and more specifically on subject that are not well documented or explored elsewhere (I like “terra incognita”)

During the last few months I’ve realized that, since I like C and love working with C++, the NDK would be the next world to discover (after playing with SDK last year). Since December, I was waiting for Gingerbread and its NativeActivity, but I’ve started to use the new revision of the NDK, r5b that goes a step further in supporting C++. I’ve also been interested on being able to porting some existing (open- or closed-)  source code, like Ogre 3D, with build tools like CMake for Android on Standalone Toolchain.

Since all the resource I use for my research and all the forum I follow are in English, I’ve switched in April to a full English blog, and rewrote everything (not much at this time).

And trying to improve the quality of my posts is teaching me a lot of tips and tricks and give me some additional fun! Now, I would like to improve the visibility of all this materials I’ve assembled, to get some feedback on my work on it :)

Now that I’ve switched to Gingerbread, stay tuned for more experiments!
